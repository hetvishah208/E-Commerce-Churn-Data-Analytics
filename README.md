# E-Commerce-Churn-Data-Analytics
This comprehensive e-commerce analysis project is centered on unraveling the intricate dynamics of customer churn, employing advanced analytics tools such as PySpark, SQL queries, machine learning algorithms, and innovative techniques like Graph Frames and KMeans clustering. 

The primary focus is to understand the factors influencing customer churn, with an emphasis on younger customer segments, the impact of gender and brand on churn, and the significance of personalized customer interactions.

Throughout the project is delved into feature engineering, introducing the novel "PurchaseToAgeRatio" metric to capture nuanced relationships between age and purchasing behavior. This addition contributes significantly to this churn analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer behavior. Additionally, the segmentation of churned customers based on gender and brand unveils specific groups that are more prone to churn, offering valuable insights for targeted retention strategies.

One of the innovative aspects of this study is the application of GraphFrames for network analysis and KMeans clustering to segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior. These methodologies enable us to identify influential customers whose churn may have cascading effects on broader customer networks. This approach goes beyond traditional churn analysis, offering strategic insights for customer retention and resource allocation.

In conclusion, this research pioneers innovative approaches to customer churn analysis in the e-commerce domain, emphasizing the importance of personalized strategies and understanding network dynamics. The overarching goal is to foster sustained business growth through improved customer satisfaction, personalized marketing strategies, and strategic resource allocation, ultimately reducing churn and ensuring long-term business success.
